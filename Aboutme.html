												<h3>Professional identity as future TAS teacher  </h3>

											<div>
												
											<p>As a professional future TAS teacher I would have to be acknowledged for an undergraduate Bachelorsâ€™ degree. Both the innovative and practical challenges of teaching subjects are enjoyable. Subjects such as engineering, food technology, information and software technology, software design and development, and textiles and design. 

												As a teacher who has gained professional knowledge and skills through formal education and practical experience. I have gained that as a teacher you need to provide additional, compassionate care to students by identifying their needs and planning, obtaining, and implementing techniques and assessment processes that promote learning.
												
												As a professional Tas teacher having qualities and characteristics such as being enthusiastic, patient and approachable, strong communion skills, strong knowledge, discipline and professionalism. These qualities are important because this is what makes a teacher professional and creates their identity as an educator. 
												
												Professional growth can help professional Tas teachers improve experience management and control. This improves teaching assistant quality and allows them to focus on students rather than paperwork. Students expect teachers to be highly skilled in the topics they teach. 
												</p>

												<h4>Introduction about myself</h4>
										
										</header>

											<p>I am 21 years old turning 22 on October 30th. I am Chaldean from Iraq which is located in the Middle East. My native language is Chaldean but I can also speak and understand arabic. I moved to Australia in 2010, so I have been living here for 11 years. I played netball for about 4 years and started going to the gym for 5 years. I have been working in retail for 5 years and also worked at an after school care center. My interests are going to the gym, cooking, hanging out with friends and definitely not university or doing assignments. 

												I chose to become a tas teacher because as educators, we can use technology to create authentic learning that is more genuine and useful than ever before. Students, for example, can: publish their work with an authentic audience through a website or social networking sites. As a pre-service teacher within my experience 
												</p>

											<p>The reason why I chose to become a TAS teacher is because I always used to want to become a teacher. ALthoughI was influenced by my TAS teachers from high school but mainly my textiles teacher. 
												I was doing textiles for year 11 and 12 and was really enjoying it. Having a supportive, helpful and intelligent teacher as her influenced me to become like her especially during year 12 when she would help us and spend extra time out of class for us to finish our majors.
												 The relationship TAS teachers had when I was in high school was really fun and nice because so many teachers created long life friendships from it and I really liked that about them and the whole idea of becoming a TAS teacher.</p>
